Being a multilingual speaker, I started out my career in IT working as Localisation QA Tester, but have been working mainly as functional QA, testing webistes, web-based applications and mobile Apps.

However, I have always been interested in the technical aspects of how websites and Apps work, further than simply working on them as a manual tester. I came to the conclusion that it would not be possible to advance in that direction without taking a sharp turn. Hence I joined Makers Academy, as I believed that my personal drive and Makers Academy's engine will help me divert my route and take that just mentioned turn. I see myself working as junior developer in either a startup or a medium-sized organisation in London.

## Skills

#### Communication

I believe in communicating 'effectively'. It entails being positive, clear and inquisitive. Listening and then asking questions if needed is equally important, as to avoid misunderstandings which may lead to time loss. I have been praised in different occasions for being an excellent communicator:

- 'Cristina is approachable, a great communicator and listener, too.' - my ex boss about me.
At my last work place, Product Madness, my line manager and other teams' members recognised how well I related to the people I worked with, and also on how I would always keep a friendly and positive attitude.

- Working with colleagues in different time zones
In three companies I worked with team members in a different time zone. As software tester, it was key to log clear, detailed and precise defects as well as to be attentive and helpful during our remote standup calls.

- Multilingual Tourist Info Point Assistant
During this university's internship I excelled at helping out tourists thanks to my good communication skills and spoken languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French) and demonstrated to be a proactive worker (e.g. managing long queues of tourists by organising them into small groups sorted by language).

#### Organisation

An important quality in any job and also in our private life. A few examples of how I demonstrated being organised:

- Contributed to the organisation of the work flow by suggesting creating or reviewing processes (e.g. suggested the Head of QA to create a shared Google Drive folder subdivided into months so that our developers could upload local builds there instead of dropping them via Slack)
- Contributed to the development of QA apprentice by writing down a detailed guide to applications and providing him with tasks to perform based on personal experience and available documentation
- Wrote down notes every day, as after each release was asked to write done what went well and what didn't during the release life time

#### Attention to detail

I have always been mindful of details, be it when I test, code or read a specification document.

- Achieved the 'employee of the week' nominee while at Gamesys for logging more than 30 bugs against one feature
- At Product Madness, noticed that big title missing from our game pack drop, which required a new one
- Pointed out that the graphic text in a CTA button was misleading and had it changed by the CRM marketing team
- Found and added new test scenarios at Gamesys, Hearst Magazines and Product Madness

#### Multiculturalism

Having been brought up in a bilingual family, I have loved experiencing different cultures from an early stage.

- Worked in multilingual/multicultural companies in London
- Worked remotely with team members based overseas
- Proficient in English, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. Good French.
- Lived in 3 countries
