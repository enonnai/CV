Former Software Tester with a keen interest in the technical aspects of how websites and Apps work, which led me to make the best decision I could have made. After two months of preparation, I have been studying at Makers Academy for 16 intensive weeks, where I have been learning the fundamentals of software development by working on different and more and more challenging projects (both solo and as part of a team).
 
My experience at Makers Academy has also ingrained in me the importance of best coding practises. I am now looking forward to being part of a team where pair programming, communication and knowledge sharing is key for both the success of the company and for reaching personal goals, as I believe that learning every day and seeing your product grow and improve is one of the most rewarding and satisfying aspects of being a software engineer. 
 
Tech Skills: Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Capybara, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Jasmine, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL
 
Methodologies: TDD, pair programming, Agile development, XP values, team projects, code reviews

## Skills
 
#### Communication
 
I believe in communicating 'effectively'. It entails being positive, clear and inquisitive. Listening and then asking questions if needed is equally important, to avoid misunderstandings which may lead to time loss:
 
- 'Cristina is approachable, a great communicator and listener, too.' - my ex boss about me.
At my last workplace, Product Madness, my line manager and other teams' members recognised how well I related to the people I worked with, and also on how I would always keep a friendly and positive attitude.
 
#### Adaptability
 
- In three companies I worked with team members in different time zones. As software tester, it was key to log clear, detailed and precise defects as well as to be attentive and helpful during our remote standup calls.
 
#### Fast Learner
 
- Grasped a good understanding of different languages and technologies in a short period of time through both self-taught learning, online resources and Makers Academyâ€™s resources. 
 
#### Organisation
 
A few examples of how I demonstrated being organised:
 
- Contributed to the organisation of the work flow by suggesting creating or reviewing processes (e.g. suggested the Head of QA to create a shared Google Drive folder subdivided into months so that our developers could upload local builds there instead of dropping them via Slack)
- Contributed to the development of QA apprentice by writing down a detailed guide to applications and providing him with tasks to perform based on personal experience and available documentation
- Wrote down notes every day, as after each release was asked to write done what went well and what didn't during the release lifetime
 
#### Good eye for detail
 
- Achieved the 'employee of the week' nominee while at Gamesys for logging more than 30 bugs against one feature
- At Product Madness, noticed that big title missing from our game pack drop, which required a new one
- Pointed out that the graphic text in a CTA button was misleading and had it changed by the CRM marketing team
- Found and added new test scenarios at Gamesys, Hearst Magazines and Product Madness
 
#### Multiculturalism
 
Having been brought up in a bilingual family, I have loved experiencing different cultures from an early stage.
 
- Worked in multilingual/multicultural companies in London
- Worked remotely with team members based overseas
- Proficient in English, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. Good French.
- Lived in 3 countries
